## Twitter Redux

This is week 2 of working on a basic twitter app, which now includes a basic hamburger menu and profile page.

I spent way too long on getting the hamburger menu to work properly, so ran out of time before getting to the optional features this time :(

In particular, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how (if possible?) to customize the navigation for each new view I presented -- it seemed like all the views presented via the menu logic kept the same nav bar. Need to do more digging.

Time spent: 12

### Features

#### Required

Hamburger menu

- [X] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
- [X] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view. The menu can look similar to the LinkedIn menu below or feel free to take liberty with the UI.

Profile page

- [X] Contains the user header view
- [X] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers

Home Timeline

- [X] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

#### Optional

Profile page

- [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.
- [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
- [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.

Account switching
- [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
- [ ] Tap account to switch to
- [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
- [ ] Swipe to delete an account
